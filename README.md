# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Your Task

Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, plays a significant role within the electronics industry, as it empowers businesses and consumers alike to conveniently engage in online buying and selling of electronic products. In the latest available data from 2021, the industry in the United States alone was estimated to have generated the substantial amount of US$2.54 trillion, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to the prevalence of these platforms, developers should understand the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites.

Your task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. You’ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the readme of your project.

## User Story

Hey there, This application was a interesting one. I have to say making this was a bit of a struggle when first trying to work with the routes and models but after some research it became more clear on what was needed. Useing insomnia was a fun experiance and I learned a lot about how we can use route data and use gets,posts, and Deletes to manipulate the data as needed.
